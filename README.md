# WordPress Developer Work Offer

Bluejay is a company that mostly works WordPress projects. We use third party and custom code. We like the smart decision more than the perfect code or the latest programming language or fashion platforms. 

Our proposal of test to can check your skills is: 

-> Build a wp plugin that can show related posts in a widget.

-> In the admin side the editors should be able connect post with other posts, pages and custom post types

-> In frontend the editors can show the related post of the current post in a simple widget, can be a simple <ul> <li> with title and a link to the post.

-> We don't like the heavy scripts, so we recommend use plugin generators like https://wppb.me/, but fell free to use the structure that you want. 

-> When you finish, send a pull-request to this repo with your plugin, and add your comments to the README file.
